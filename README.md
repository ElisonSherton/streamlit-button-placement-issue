# streamlit-button-placement-issue

This repo is meant to serve as a solution to [this question](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/previous-and-next-button-move-their-location/66287).

Use `generate_data.py` to generate the data present in `data.csv`.

Run `app.py` to have a look at the figures in action. Here I have used a single figure to display both the plots as I thought this is neat.

However if you want, you can look at `app2.py`. It is closer to your implementation.
